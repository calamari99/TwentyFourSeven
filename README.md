# TwentyFour7 

TwentyFour7 will provide a user the ability to create a planner for team tasks. This system is designed for team leads who are looking to allocate their resources effectively by prudently managing both task assignments and team members. 
I have taken ispiration from my a few of my favorite tools, Slack and Asana, and will be using this application as a brainstorming tool.

#### Basic Feature Include:
- creating a master task
- creating/removing tasks under master task
- assigning people to each task
- etc.

### Stage 1:
##### User Stories:
- as a User, should be able to create a master task
- as a User, should be able to input a master task's name
- as a User, should be able to create a subTask under a master task
- as a User, should be able to input a sub task's name
- as a User, should be able to create a person
- as a User, should be able to add a person to a sub task


### Stage 2:
- as a user, I want to be able to autosave my MasterTask to file
  -  when new mastertask/subtask is added
  -  upon quitting application
  
- as a user, I want to be able to reload my saved MasterTask into interface

### Stage 3:
- as a user, I want to be able to use to GUI to create a master task
  - and add / delete subtasks
  - view subtasks
  - 
  
### Instructions for Grader:
- Clicking the button "Create a new master task" generates a new master task from scratch
  - User is then prompted to enter a name for his/her master task, pressing enter/clicking submit will save the master task
  - User can add/remove subtasks to his master task and view the tasks assigned
  - 
  
- Clicking the button "Reload a master task" loads the previously saved task from JSON file stored
